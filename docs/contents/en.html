        <p>An utility to search warps in Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow and Castlevania: Harmony of Disonnance.</p>

        <h1>Main Window</h1>
        <p>Click on File -> Open ROM... to load an Aos/Hod game rom. This tool currently supports USA, JPN and EUR version of both games.</p>
        <h2>Search Warp Destination</h2>
        <p>Select "Where do I warp to from here". Right click on the map to select a room, move the mouse to show whether a warp is valid from the specific place. 
            A green/blue square means you can exit the room safely at that place and warp to another place. 
            A red square means if you exit room at that place, game will freeze/softlock/crash/go wrong. 
            Left click at a green/blue square to show where you will warp to.</p>
        <div class="image"><image src="../images/en/1.png" /></div>
        <p>You may notice somewhere inside a room is also green. This means if you can somehow trigger a "room change" inside that room, you will be able warp to another place.</p>
        <div class="image"><image src="../images/en/2.png" /></div>
        <p>An orange square means the program cannot determine whether this warp will work. 
            This involves 2 cases: One is that the target position is out of target room; 
            another is that this warp reqiures certain flags to work (only in HoD). Both of them only happens in very rare case though.</p>
        <h2>Search Warp Source</h2>
        <p>Select "Where can I warp from to here". Right click on the map to select a room, and some of the rooms will become black in the map. 
            Left click a blacked room to show how can you access selected room from the blacked room. You can also choose a room in the room list on the left.</p>
        <div class="image"><image src="../images/en/3.png" /></div>
        <p>You can change search level to exclude conditions you don't want:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Search for glitched inside-room exits: This is the condition described above that you need to trigger a room change inside the room. 
                Currently there is no valid way to trigger that, so these exits are not searched by default.</li>
            <div class="image"><image src="../images/1.png" /></div>
            <li>Search for far away exits: Search for exits that are far away from the room. Normally as soon as you leave a room, it will trigger a room change, 
                so exits are always beside the room. Far away exits are usually used in death warp of AoS.</li>
            <div class="image"><image src="../images/2.png" /></div>
            <li>Search for exits 2 blocks away right to the 1-block-width room (HoD only): In HoD, when a room is 1 block in width, 
                leave the room at more than 16px in the right will be considered as exiting the room at 2 blocks instead of 1 block away from the right. 
                This is HoD only beacause in AoS, no matter how far you leave the 1-block-width room from the right, 
                it is always considered to be exiting the room 1 block away from the right.</li>
            <div class="image"><image src="../images/3.png" /></div>
            <li>Search for diagonal exits: Search for exits that are diagonal to the room. It is sometime not possible to do that warp.</li>
            <div class="image"><image src="../images/4.png" /></div>
            <li>Search for door warp (HoD only): Will include red door warp in HoD. 
                These warps are just exiting a 1-block-width room at 2 blocks away from the right. Red doors are just making it easier.</li>
            <div class="image"><image src="../images/5.png" /></div>  
        </ul>
        <h1>Custom ROM Window</h1>
        <p>The program can automatically detect the version of the game rom. However, if the programe failed to recognize it correctly, 
            you can alse set the version of the game rom yourself, by clicking the text in the bottom left of the window. 
            You can also click on File -> Open Custom ROM... to forcibly load a rom with custom settings.</p>
